		#  --- PART NUMBER ONE ---
		# Here you have incoming data submitted through a form!
		# You can access components of a form through form.IDENTIFIER.data
		# So for example to get a name you could do 
		# 				name = form.name.data
		# In the default setup for this tutorial, only name and icecream_fav are available
		# 
		# Instructions: use form data to insert things into the database, and display a success message.
		# Watch out! If a name already exists you will want to use update() not insert().
		# See examples and the jakedb source code for help.
		# ------------------------

		jake = db.get(name='Jake') # example usage - replace with your code

# --- PART NUMBER TWO ---
# Write a route to display all info in the database.
# Hint: you need to render an html template!
